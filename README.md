# Representation Alignment

REPA paper describes how a model's vision components could be lacking due to conditioning based on language or text. Adding vision or other representational conditioning can help the model get a better understanding and thus representation in generative AI models.

Experimental aspects to applying representation alignment to models, with a focus on diffusion/DiT models.
